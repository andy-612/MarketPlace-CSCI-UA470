# MarketPlace System

## Description and Vision

- We believe our marketplace system helps facilitate trading strongly between buyers and sellers. Different buyers can come to this platform to create a profile, browse products available for sale, purchase products, and leave reviews for products. As for the sellers, we envisioned a single platform manager that interfaces with the many sellers who are able to upload products to the manager. This is essentially a Costco-like business model to facilitate the sourcing of products from different sellers and places, and enabling faster distribution to customers.
